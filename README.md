## General Information
- The dataset is about the sale of houses in Australia
- The Surprise Housing company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- Goal : Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. Also determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Linear Regression shows the case of overfitting
- Ridge and Lasso regression yield almost same evaluation metrics
- 41 features seem to be significant for the Sale Price predictions
